# The Sheep Farmer

The Sheep Farmer is a simple yet competitive game. 
It was created using HTML, CSS and Javascript. 
By clicking each sheep image the user will then be able to deposit the sheep to the trailer. There is a built in timer calculating the duration it took for the user to complete the task, therefore giving the opportunity to beat you and your friendâ€™s time with each round that you play.

## Testing 

I firstly tested the buttons to make sure they all showed and concealed the correct elements, this all worked accordingly.
 
Then I tested the sheep, Making sure they were all visible and correctly positioned at the right time in both the field and in the trailer.
 
I then finished by testing the timer by publicly releasing the website to my family and friends, all of which returned to me with positive feedback, satisfactory results and scores as low as 1 second.
